# Introduction to SQL database in Microsoft Fabric

**SQL database** in Microsoft Fabric provides a familiar, fully managed SQL environment within the Fabric ecosystem. It combines the scalability and performance of cloud-native databases with deep integration into Fabric’s analytics and data experiences. Developers, analysts, and business users can all leverage SQL syntax to query, transform, and analyze data alongside other Fabric workloads. It is based on **Azure SQL Database** and uses the same SQL Server engine under the hood.

### Key benefits of using SQL database in Fabric:
- Native integration with Fabric’s end-to-end analytics platform (Data Engineering, Data Science, Power BI)
- Familiar SQL experience, lowering the barrier for anyone with prior SQL Server or T-SQL knowledge.
- Fully managed – no need to handle infrastructure, backups, or scaling.
- Secure and governed by Fabric’s centralized workspace and role-based access control.
- Fast time-to-value – quickly create, load, and query data for analytics and reporting.
- Set up for analytics by automatically replicating the data into OneLake in near real-time - based on the underlying technology of **Mirroring in Fabric**
- Connectable in all the same ways as **Azure SQL Database**, plus a **web-based editor in the Fabric portal**

## Section 1: Getting started

    <img alt="A picture of a read only data preview of the Address table" src="../../graphics/Introduction/ExploreDataPreview.png" style="width:800px;">

4. After browsing the data in the Address table, **close** the Data preview by clicking on the **X** next to the **Address Data preview tab**.

    <img alt="A picture of closing the Data preview by clicking on the X next to the Address Data preview tab" src="../../graphics/Introduction/ExploreDataPreviewCloseNEW.png" style="width:600px;">

5. Now, click the **New Query** button on the tool bar
    
    <img alt="A picture of clicking the New Query button on the tool bar" src="../../graphics/Introduction/ExploreNewQuery.png" style="width:600px;">

    which will open a new query editor window so you can work directly with the database. 

    <img alt="A picture of opening a new query editor window so one can work directly with the database" src="../../graphics/Introduction/ExploreQueryEditor.png" style="width:600px;">

6. You can close the gray **Copilot Preview Banner**, click the X on the right side - you'll get back to Copilot later.

    <img alt="A picture of removing the gray Copilot Preview Banner by clicking the X on the right side" src="../../graphics/Introduction/ExploreQueryCopilotClose.png" style="width:600px;">

7. Once the banner is gone, be sure to click in the SQL editor sheet so that the next step will copy the code to the correct location.

    <img alt="A picture of clicking in the SQL editor sheet so that the next step will copy the code to the correct location" src="../../graphics/Introduction/ExploreQueryEditorFocus.png" style="width:600px;">

8. Copy and paste the following code into the query editor:

    ```
    select top 100 * from [SalesLT].[Product]
    ```

9. Once the code is in the query editor, **click the Run button** (or you can use `CTRL + Enter` as a shortcut).

    <img alt="A picture of clicking the run button in the query editor" src="../../graphics/Introduction/ExploreQueryEditorRun.png" style="width:400px;">

    You will see the **results** of the query on the **bottom of the query editor**.

    <img alt="A picture of the results of the query on the bottom of the query editor" src="../../graphics/Introduction/ExploreQueryEditorResults.png" style="width:600px;">

    Starting on the left side of the **Results area**, there are 3 options for exporting the data.

    <img alt="A picture of the 3 options for exporting the data in the results area" src="../../graphics/Introduction/ExploreQueryEditorResultsExport.png" style="width:600px;">

    From left to right, first is **download results as .xlsx (Excel) file**.

    And the last option being **download as a .json file**.

    <img alt="A picture of the download as a .json file option" src="../../graphics/Introduction/ExploreQueryEditorResultsExportJSON.png" style="width:400px;">

    And looking on the right side of the results area, you can use the **Copy** button to copy the results in multiple formats.

    <img alt="A picture of using the Copy button to copy the results in multiple formats" src="../../graphics/Introduction/ExploreQueryEditorCOPY.png" style="width:600px;">

10. Within the Database Explorer you can easily navigate through the queries you have been working with. You can do this by **clicking on the Queries folder in Explorer** on the left side of the screen and choose a particular SQL query.

    <img alt="A picture of clicking on the SQL Query 1 within the Queries folder on the left side of the Database Explorer screen." src="../../graphics/Introduction/ExploreQueryEditorQueriesFolderNEW.png" style="width:600px;">

    Also, by **clicking on the 3 dots** next to a query editor sheet name, you can duplicate, rename, delete or share a query. Shared queries a queries visible to all your teammates that have admin, contributor, or member permission in the workspace .

    <img alt="A picture of clicking on the 3 dots next to a query editor sheet name" src="../../graphics/Introduction/ExploreQueryEditor3Options.png" style="width:400px;">

### Task 3.2: Mirroring Fabric SQL database to OneLake

Mirroring in Fabric is a low-cost and low-latency solution to bring data from various systems together into a single analytics platform. [Mirroring Fabric SQL database](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/database/sql/mirroring-overview) is a feature to continuously replicate data from your operational SQL database in Fabric into the Fabric OneLake. Every SQL database in Microsoft Fabric automatically mirrors its data into Fabric OneLake within the same workspace, with no user action required. Data is being mirrored as soon as it's created or updated. SQL database in Fabric stores its data in .mdf files, just like Azure SQL Database, while mirrored data is stored as Delta files in OneLake.

With the data from your SQL database automatically mirrored in OneLake, you can write cross-database queries, joining data from other SQL databases, mirrored databases, warehouses, and lakehouses. All this is currently possible with using T-SQL queries on the SQL analytics endpoint - a SQL-based experience to analyze OneLake data in Delta tables. Creating a SQL database in Fabric creates a SQL analytics endpoint, which points to the SQL database in Fabric Delta table storage.

1. To access SQL analytics endpoint, you can switch to SQL analytics endpoint mode in SQL database in Database explorer in the top right corner.

    <img alt="A picture of drop-down list of SQL database and SQL analytics endpoint available in the top right corner of the Database explorer in the Fabric portal" src="../../graphics/Introduction/MirroringSQLAnalyticsSwitching.png" style="width:400px;">

2. Another way to access SQL analytics endpoint is from the workspace view. Let's open the workspace by selecting a workspace in the menu on the left side.

    <img alt="A picture of a opening a workspace view from the left-side navigation pane." src="../../graphics/Introduction/MirroringOpenWorkspace.png" style="width:600px;">

3. You can now observe that there's a SQL analytics endpoint available below your SQL database in Fabric item, like on the image below.

    <img alt="A picture of a workspace view of child items of SQL database in Fabric item where you can find SQL analytics endpoint with the same name as SQL database" src="../../graphics/Introduction/MirroringSQLAnalyticsWorkspaceNEW.png" style="width:600px;">

4. Let's select a SQL analytics endpoint item to open it, then select a **New SQL query** and execute the following query:
    
    ```
    select top 100 * from [SalesLT].[Product]
    ORDER BY [ProductID] DESC;
    ```

5. Let's now get back to SQL database by choosing a "SQL database" from the top right dropdown.

   <img alt="A picture of drop-down list of SQL database and SQL analytics endpoint available in the top right corner of the Database explorer in the Fabric portal." src="../../graphics/Introduction/MirroringSelectTop100.png" style="width:600px;">

6. In the SQL database query editor select _"New query"_ and execute the following query to insert one record:

    ```
    INSERT INTO [SalesLT].[Product] (
    [Name],
    [ProductNumber],
    [Color],
    [StandardCost],
    [ListPrice],
    [Size],
    [Weight],
    [ProductCategoryID],
    [ProductModelID],
    [SellStartDate],
    [SellEndDate],
    [DiscontinuedDate],
    [ThumbNailPhoto],
    [ThumbnailPhotoFileName],
    [rowguid],
    [ModifiedDate]
    ) VALUES (
    'FabCon Vienna 2025',
    'FAB2025',
    NULL,
    20250915,
    20250915,
    NULL,
    NULL,
    NULL,
    NULL,
    GETDATE(),
    NULL, 
    NULL, 
    NULL, 
    NULL,
    NEWID(),
    GETDATE()
    );
    ```
7. You can monitor the replication status of your database by navigating to the _Replication_ tab on top left corner and selecting _Monitor replication_.

    <img alt="A picture of finding the Replication and then Monitor replication buttons in the menu in the Fabric SQL database portal." src="../../graphics/Introduction/MonitorReplication.png" style="width:600px;">

8. This will open up a blade on the right side that demonstrates the status and the last mirroring refresh time.

    <img alt="A picture of database mirroring/replication monitoring blade on the right side." src="../../graphics/Introduction/MonitorTables.png" style="width:600px;">
    Click 'X' in top right corner of the Fabric Portal (just below your user icon) to close the Replication status blade.

9. Switch back to SQL Analytics endpoint through a dropdown on top right corner

    <img alt="A picture of drop-down list of SQL database and SQL analytics endpoint available in the top right corner of the Database explorer in the Fabric portal" src="../../graphics/Introduction/MirroringSQLAnalyticsSwitching.png" style="width:600px;">

10. And now rerun the same query we used before in SQL Analytics endpoint and observe that the first record on top is the one inserted via SQL database.

    <img alt="Showing results with first record on top that has values inserted via SQL database in fabric" src="../../graphics/Introduction/MirroringSQLAnalyticsTop1.png" style="width:600px;">
    
    If the new data is not visible yet that means that replication hasn't yet completed. It can take up to a minute or so.

With this, we're wrapping up the hands-on part for this module. 

It's good to know that besides SQL database in Fabric, you can also continuously replicate your existing data estate directly into Fabric's OneLake from a variety of Azure databases and external data sources, such as:
- [Azure SQL Database](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/mirroring/azure-sql-database)
- [Azure SQL Managed Instance](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/mirroring/azure-sql-managed-instance)
- [Azure Cosmos DB](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/mirroring/azure-cosmos-db)
- [Azure Databricks](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/mirroring/azure-databricks)
- [PostgreSQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/mirroring/azure-database-postgresql)
- [Snowflake](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/mirroring/snowflake)
- [SQL Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/mirroring/sql-server)
- [Open mirroring](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/mirroring/open-mirroring) - enables *any* application to write directly into a mirrored database in Fabric. 

With SQL analytics endpoint you can join your data from different items using a three-part naming convention. This way you can join data from other mirrored databases or warehouses.
